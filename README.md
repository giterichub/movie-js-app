"# movie-js-app" 
A movie app built using html, css and javascript. Used TMDB API.
Make sure to open the site using wifi networks only, I have to configure it to work for mobile networks as well. 
If you try to open the site using mobile network it most likely won't work. TMDB has been blocked by the government so some ISPs block it and some you can manage
